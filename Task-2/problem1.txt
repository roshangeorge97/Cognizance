public class problem1 {
       in this problem,we are asked to check divisiblity by three,but without using % / operator method,
    as first step we will be adding up each digit of the entered integer,for this we will divide the integer everytime by 10,and add up the remainders by forming a loop,
    the sum of all the remainders will give the sum of each digit in that integer. 
   public static void main(String[] args) {
	   Scanner scan=new Scanner(System.in);
  Declaring variables sum and reminder and initiating them to 0,
	   int sum=0;
	   int rem=0;
    taking input number from user,
	   int n=scan.nextInt();
       till the entered number is greater than 0,the loop runs, 
	     while(n>0) {
               getting reminder of the entered number by diving with 10,
	    	 rem=n%10;
               adding the reminder obtained, to sum which was already initialised to 0,sum gets added up every cycle of loop,and when n=0 the loop ends and the sum value is finalised.
	    	 sum=rem+sum;
               dividing the entered number by 10,and taking its value as a integer,this integer is again sent into loop if its greater than 0,
	    	 n=n/10;
	     }
            till final value of sum is greater than 0,we substract 3 repeatedly,
	       while(sum>0) {
	    	   sum-=3;
	       }
            if sum gets to zero,it will be divisible by three, if not it will not be divisible,
	       if(sum==0) {
	    	   System.out.println("Yes");
	       } else {
	    	   System.out.println("No");
	       }
   }
}
